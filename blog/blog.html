							As corporate IT facilitates the implementation and monitoring of processes, the value of simply carrying out rote instructions will fall while the value of inventing better methods will rise. In some cases, this may even lead to a “superstar” effect, as disproportionate rewards accrue to the very best knowledge workers. Human resource policies and corporate culture will need to evolve to support this type of worker. An effective leader and a well-designed organization will need not only to aggressively seek out and identify such individuals and the innovations they generate but also to develop and reward them appropriately.
							An analysis of companies that Erik Brynjolfsson published with Wharton professor Lorin Hitt in 2005, found that organizations successfully using IT were significantly more aggressive in vetting new hires: They considered more applicants. They scrutinized each one more intensively. They involved senior management (not just HR) early and often in the interview process. After identifying top talent, these firms invested substantially more time and money on both internal and external training and education. Furthermore, they gave their employees more discretion in how to do their jobs while linking their compensation and rewards—including promotions—more tightly to performance using a suite of metrics that was more detailed than competitors’. The costs of managing talent in this way may be high, but the payoff increases exponentially if you can leverage the talents of a high-performing manager at one location to maximize results in thousands of sites worldwide.
							The arrival of powerful new information technologies does not render obsolete all previous assumptions and insights about how to do business, but it does open up new opportunities to executives. Our research has led us to three conclusions: First of all, the data show that IT has sharpened differences among companies instead of reducing them. This reflects the fact that while companies have always varied widely in their ability to select, adopt, and exploit innovations, technology has accelerated and amplified these differences. Second, line executives matter: Highly qualified vendors, consultants, and IT departments might be necessary for the successful implementation of enterprise technologies themselves, but the real value comes from the process innovations that can now be delivered on those platforms. Fostering the right innovations and propagating them widely are both executive responsibilities—ones that can’t be delegated. Finally, the competitive shakeup brought on by IT is not nearly complete, even in the IT-intensive economy. We expect to see these altered competitive dynamics all countries, as well, as their IT investments grow.
							It is not easy for most companies to deploy enterprise IT successfully. The technologies themselves are complicated to configure and test, and changing people’s behavior and attitudes toward technology is even more challenging. Enterprise IT typically changes many jobs in major ways; this is never an easy sell to either employees or line managers. As the performance spread, concentration, and churn increase, management becomes a distinctly less comfortable profession—more unforgiving of mistakes, faster to weed out low performers. Even those executives who are prepared will not necessarily survive the inevitable turbulence. But those who do can expect outsize rewards—at least until another player comes along and uses IT to propagate a business innovation that’s even better.

					To survive, or better yet thrive, in this more competitive environment, the mantra for any CEO should be, “Deploy, innovate, and propagate”: First, deploy a consistent technology platform. Then separate yourself from the pack by coming up with better ways of working. Finally, use the platform to propagate these business innovations widely and reliably. In this regard, deploying IT serves two distinct roles—as a catalyst for innovative ideas and as an engine for delivering them. Each of the three steps in the mantra presents different and critical management challenges, not least of which have to do with questions of centralization and autonomy
					Since the mid-1990s, the commercial availability of enterprise software packages has added a new item to the list of senior management’s responsibilities: Determining which aspects of their companies’ operating models should be globally (or at least widely) consistent, then using technology to replicate them with high fidelity. Some top teams have pounced on the opportunity. Many more, however, have embraced this responsibility only reluctantly, unwilling to tackle two formidable barriers to deployment: fragmentation and autonomy.

					<b>Why does my business need IT?</b>

						it’s not just you. It really is getting harder to outpace the other guys. Our recent research finds that since the middle of the 1990s, which marked the mainstream adoption of the internet and commercial enterprise software, competition within the  economy has accelerated to unprecedented levels. There are a number of possible reasons for this quickening, including M&A activity, the opening up of global markets, and companies’ continuing R&D efforts. However, we found that a central catalyst in this shift is the massive increase in the power of IT investments.
					To better understand when and where IT confers competitive advantage in today’s economy, we studied  companies in all industries from the 1960s through 2005, looking at relevant performance indicators from each (including sales, earnings, profitability, and market capitalization) and found some striking patterns: Since the mid-1990s, a new competitive dynamic has emerged—greater gaps between the leaders and laggards in an industry, more concentrated and winner-take-all markets, and more churn among rivals in a sector. Strikingly, this pattern closely matches the turbulent “creative destruction” mode of capitalism that was first predicted over 60 years ago by economist Joseph Schumpeter. This accelerated competition has coincided with a sharp increase in the quantity and quality of IT investments, as more organizations have moved to bolster (or altogether replace) their existing operating models using the internet and enterprise software. Tellingly, the changes in competitive dynamics are most apparent in precisely those sectors that have spent the most on information technology, even when we controlled for other factors.
					This pattern is a familiar one in markets for digitized products like computer software and music. Those industries have long been dominated by both a winner-take-all dynamic and high turbulence, as each group of dominant innovators is threatened by succeeding waves of innovation. Consider how quickly Google supplanted Yahoo, which supplanted AltaVista and others that created the search engine market from nothing. Or the relative speed with which new recording artists can dominate sales in a category.
					Most industries have historically been fairly immune from this kind of Schumpeterian competition. However, our findings show that the internet and enterprise IT are now accelerating competition within traditional industries in the broader economy. Why? Not because more products are becoming digital but because more processes are: Just as a digital photo or a web-search algorithm can be endlessly replicated quickly and accurately by copying the underlying bits, a company’s unique business processes can now be propagated with much higher fidelity across the organization by embedding it in enterprise information technology. As a result, an innovator with a better way of doing things can scale up with unprecedented speed to dominate an industry. In response, a rival can roll out further process innovations throughout its product lines and geographic markets to recapture market share. Winners can win big and fast, but not necessarily for very long.

					<b><big>What is Ecommerce?</big><br><br></b>

						Ecommerce, also known as electronic commerce or internet commerce, refers to the buying and selling of goods or services using the internet, and the transfer of money and data to execute these transactions. Ecommerce is often used to refer to the sale of physical products online, but it can also describe any kind of commercial transaction that is facilitated through the internet.
						Whereas e-business refers to all aspects of operating an online business, ecommerce refers specifically to the transaction of goods and services.
						The history of Ecommerce begins with the first ever online sale: on the August 11, 1994 a man sold a CD by the band Sting to his friend through his website NetMarket, an American retail platform. This is the first example of a consumer purchasing a product from a business through the World Wide Web—or “ecommerce” as we commonly know it today.
						Since then, ecommerce has evolved to make products easier to discover and purchase through online retailers and marketplaces.  Independent freelancers, small businesses, and large corporations have all benefited from ecommerce, which enables them to sell their goods and services at a scale that was not possible with traditional offline retail.<br>
						<i>Global retail ecommerce sales are projected to reach 27$ Trillion by 2020.</i><br><br>

						<u>Types of Ecommerce Models</u><br><br>
						There are four main types of ecommerce models that can describe almost every transaction that takes place between consumers and businesses.<br><br>
						1.<u> Business to Consumer (B2C): </u><br>
						When a business sells a good or service to an individual consumer (e.g. You buy a pair of shoes from an online retailer).<br>
						2.<u> Business to Business (B2B):</u><br>
						When a business sells a good or service to another business (e.g. A business sells software-as-a-service for other businesses to use)<br>

						3.<u> Consumer to Consumer (C2C):</u><br>
						When a consumer sells a good or service to another consumer (e.g. You sell your old furniture on eBay to another consumer).<br>

						4. <u>Consumer to Business (C2B):</u><br>
						When a consumer sells their own products or services to a business or organization (e.g. An influencer offers exposure to their online audience in exchange for a fee, or a photographer licenses their photo for a business to use).<br><br>
						<i><u>Examples of Ecommerce</u></i><br>
						Ecommerce can take on a variety of forms involving different transactional relationships between businesses and consumers, as well as different objects being exchanged as part of these transactions.<br>
						1.<u>Retail:</u> <br>
						The sale of a product by a business directly to a customer without any intermediary.<br>

						2.<u> Wholesale:</u><br>
						The sale of products in bulk, often to a retailer that then sells them directly to consumers.<br>

						3.<u> Dropshipping:</u><br> 
						The sale of a product, which is manufactured and shipped to the consumer by a third party.<br>

						4. <u>Crowdfunding:</u><br> 
						The collection of money from consumers in advance of a product being available in order to raise the startup capital necessary to bring it to market.<br>

						5. <u>Subscription: </u><br>
						The automatic recurring purchase of a product or service on a regular basis until the subscriber chooses to cancel.<br>

						6. <u>Physical products:</u><br> 
						Any tangible good that requires inventory to be replenished and orders to be physically shipped to customers as sales are made.<br>

						7.<u> Digital products:</u><br> 
						Downloadable digital goods, templates, and courses, or media that must be purchased for consumption or licensed for use.<br>

						8.<u> Services:</u><br>
						A skill or set of skills provided in exchange for compensation. The service provider’s time can be purchased for a fee.
